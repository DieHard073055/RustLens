## 📝 Instructions to Complete

Due to response size limits, I'll provide you with a Python script to generate the remaining questions programmatically.

Would you like me to:
1. **Continue generating** questions in smaller batches (10-15 at a time)?
2. **Provide a template** for you to easily add your own questions?
3. **Generate a Python script** that creates the remaining 55 questions automatically?

Let me know your preference!
